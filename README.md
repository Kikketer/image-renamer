image-renamer
=============

A pretty static and dumb image renaming script.  It's really just a NodeJS learning tool for me and attempting to smooth image renaming over for my wife.

It assumes the files are .jpg in the same folder as the `rename.js` and renames using my very specific requirements:

```
YYYY-MM-DD_HHmm_<original filename>.jpg
```

Feel free to use this for your own use... and REFUSE to pay for a product that does exactly this.
